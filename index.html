                    I have been solving all the project ideas
                    on roadmap.sh and I am surprised how far I
                    have come from where I started.<br><br>
                    Highly recommended!

                    Since starting my career in 2021. I have 
                    only followed one resource, roadmap.sh, it
                    truely helped me go from 0 to having a job
                    and changing the financial trajectory of my
                    family

                I find myself recommending roadmap.sh to all
                the internees or junior developers. It's a great
                way to skill up and grow in your career.

                roadmap.sh is an incredible resource. I was fortunate
                to discover it during my university days in 2018. Back
                then, it was just a single repository with three images.
                It's amazing to see how much impact it has had on millions
                of lives since then.
