                I find myself recommending roadmap.sh to all
                the internees or junior developers. It's a great
                way to skill up and grow in your career.

                roadmap.sh is an incredible resource. I was fortunate
                to discover it during my university days in 2018. Back
                then, it was just a single repository with three images.
                It's amazing to see how much impact it has had on millions
                of lives since then.
