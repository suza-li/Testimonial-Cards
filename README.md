# Objective of Project
The objective of this project is to solidify the understandings of CSS layouts and styling.

# Challenges
The biggest challenge for this project was figuring out how to style the
cards. I went through many different routes of layout but I ended up
going with a static type of styling of the page. In the future I plan on
using javascript to make the page more dynamic and the styling responsive
to the size of the webpage as well as screens. In the end, I learned how to create different types of testimonial cards.
